## Design Concept for School Website

### Visual Style:
Modern, clean, and inviting. The design should convey a sense of professionalism, warmth, and community. It should be easy to navigate and visually appealing to parents, students, and staff.

### Color Palette:
Primary colors: Blue (e.g., #0056b3 - a professional and trustworthy color) and Green (e.g., #28a745 - representing growth and nature).
Secondary colors: Light grey (e.g., #f8f9fa) for backgrounds and accents, and a warm yellow/orange (e.g., #ffc107) for highlights and call-to-action buttons to add vibrancy.

### Typography:
Headings: A clean, modern sans-serif font like 'Montserrat' or 'Open Sans' for readability and a contemporary feel.
Body text: A highly readable sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Lato' for clear and comfortable reading.

### Layout:
